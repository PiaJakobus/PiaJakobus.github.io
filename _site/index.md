I am a computational astrophysicist at the Hamburger Sternwarte working with Prof. Stephan Rosswog. Currently, I'm learning about neutrinos and the important role they play in binary neutron star mergers. I completed my Ph.D. at the School of Physics & Astronomy at Monash University in Melbourne under A/Prof. Bernhard Mueller and Prof. Alexander Heger, where I studied core-collapse supernovae and their progenitors emphasizing nuclear physics. Additionally, I study Twin stars- those are stable hydrostatic configurations that appear as an additional branch in the mass-radius curve of neutron stars. Their appearance would be a smoking gun for the phase transition of Quantum-Chromodyanmics.
